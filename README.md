#Kinedu Bookshop

I think I have met all the requirements, validation is not optimal (like capitalization).
It might be a bit too "early" to add more UX or performance-optimization to the website, like
concatenation of JavaScript or putting first-needed css in the header and things like that.

But I made a little start with that, but not too much.

##Extra
* Added icons for buttons
* Added favicon
* Added placeholder image in base64
* Validation, not super strict, only with PHP
* Downloading images with lazy-loading
* Preconnecting to another image URL
* Prefetching unveil.js for lazy-loading, which is loaded later
* I have left out the fields for validation that are okay, turns out it's confusing for users
